# CardApp

Welcome, travelers! ðŸŽ‰

**CardApp** is a full-stack application designed for managing card requests. This application leverages the power of Java Spring Boot for the backend (BE), where most of the business logic resides, and React for the frontend (FE), which handles data representation and user interactions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several packages to maintain a clean and manageable codebase:

Additionally, the project includes separate directories for unit tests to ensure code reliability and maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot
- **Frontend:** React
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (hosted on AWS RDS)
- **Messaging:** Apache Kafka (hosted on AWS MSK)
- **Containerization:** Docker (optional, for local development)
- **Security:** OAuth 2.0
- **Deployment:** AWS EC2 (Linux and Windows instances)

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project locally or deploying it, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven
- Node.js and npm
- Docker (optional, for local development)
- AWS CLI (for managing AWS resources)
- An AWS account with necessary permissions

## Installation

### Backend

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CardApp.git
   cd CardApp
Configure Application Properties:

Update the application-prod.properties file with your AWS RDS database credentials and other necessary configurations.

Build the Application:

Using Maven:

bash
mvn clean package
Frontend
Navigate to Frontend Directory:

bash
cd path/to/your/react-app
Install Dependencies:

bash
npm install
Build the Application:

bash
npm run build
Running the Application
Backend
To run the backend application locally:

Ensure PostgreSQL is Accessible:

The backend connects to a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS RDS. Ensure your local environment can access this database.

Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
java -jar target/CardApp-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod
To keep the application running after closing the terminal, consider using nohup or configuring it as a systemd service (recommended for production).

Frontend
To run the frontend application locally:

Start the React Application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Access the Application:

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

Deployment
Backend: Deployed on an AWS EC2 Linux instance.
Frontend: Deployed on an AWS EC2 Windows instance.
Kafka: Deployed on an AWS MSK cluster.
Security
For simplicity, this project uses OAuth 2.0 for securing the backend services. In a production environment, it is recommended to use more robust security mechanisms such as AWS Vault or similar secrets management services.

Frontend Security
The frontend application includes a mock login system. In a real-world scenario, proper authentication flows should be implemented, potentially leveraging services like Auth0. Currently, the login is simulated within the frontend, and the token is used to access protected resources.

Backend Security
The backend is secured using OAuth 2.0. All API endpoints require a valid JWT token, except for the /api/v1/get-token endpoint which is publicly accessible for obtaining tokens. In a real-world environment, a dedicated security microservice should handle authentication and authorization.

Kafka Topics
Two Kafka topics are created for managing card statuses:

card_status

Purpose: Receives messages for card creation requests.
Usage: Each card creation request is sent as a message to this topic.
Consumer: In a real environment, a consumer would listen to this topic to process card creation.
card_status_updates

Purpose: Receives updates on the status of card requests.
Usage: After processing a card request (approval or rejection), a message is sent to this topic.
Consumer: The backend application subscribes to this topic to update the card status in the database accordingly.
Simulator
A simulator is included to mimic the behavior of the card processing system. You can send status updates by accessing the following endpoint:

{{url}}/simulate/status-update?oib=54545182222&status=REJECTED
This will send a message to the card_status_updates topic, allowing you to test the application's response to status changes.

Configuration
All configurations are managed via the application-prod.properties file.


Note: In real-world applications, sensitive information such as database credentials and OAuth secrets should be managed using secure methods like AWS Secrets Manager or Vault
